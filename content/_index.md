# FOSS Miskatonic University Project

## Goal
The goal of this project is to design, build and create a modern day model of Lovecraft's Miskatonic University campus based on his writings and inspired by the writings and artwork of others who add to the universe. The output of which will be a combination of 3D models and an interactive environment using the Godot game engine. These may be used freely in any project.

## Introduction
Where the Miskatonic University is involved there are contradictions, and suprisingly, pieces left to be added. Using many reference images, lovecraft country aesthetic, maps made for board games and by fans, we've pieced together what the campus would look like in the late 80's. Based on this, there's enough to bring it into the 21st century, using artistic license.

## Project Ethos
Lovecraft wanted to share his universe. We'd like to share his and flesh out a small part of his universe, specifically the Miskatonic University. The main effort will be shared over git repository but if you think or feel you can contribute better through other channels then we'll be on IRC, email and matrix chat. This is a labor of love, only FOSS assets will be used.
